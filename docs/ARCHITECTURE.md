**Story Smith: Architecture Guide**

---

---

## **Overview**

This document provides an in-depth look at the architecture of Story Smith. It outlines the key components, their responsibilities, and how they interact to deliver a cohesive and modular game experience.

---

## **Core Principles**

1. **Modularity**:
    - Each component is self-contained, enabling easy updates, extensions, and debugging.
2. **Scalability**:
    - Designed to accommodate future features and content without significant restructuring.
3. **Separation of Concerns**:
    - Each module handles a specific responsibility, minimizing interdependencies.

---

## **High-Level Architecture**

Story Smith consists of the following primary layers:

1. **Game Logic**:
    - Manages core gameplay, including narrative progression, class systems, and boss encounters.
2. **Data Layer**:
    - Handles configuration files (`JSON`) for narrative content, class definitions, and boss mechanics.
3. **Rendering Layer**:
    - Handles user interface and stage rendering, ensuring an immersive and visually engaging experience.
4. **Integration Layer**:
    - Orchestrates communication between modules, ensuring seamless interactions.

## **Component Breakdown**

### **1. Game Logic**

- **`main.py`**:
    - Coordinates the game loop, updates game state, and renders frames.
- **`classes.py`**:
    - Loads class definitions from `classes.json` and manages stats, abilities, and interactions.
- **`boss.py`**:
    - Handles multi-zone boss encounters, including health, abilities, and visual rendering.
- **`storyteller.py`**:
    - Manages narrative progression and branching based on player choices.

---

### **2. Data Layer**

- **Configuration Files**:
    - `classes.json`: Defines character classes, attributes, and abilities.
    - `story.json`: Contains branching story paths and player choices.
    - `boss.json`: Specifies boss entities, zones, and abilities.
- **`settings.json`**:
    - Provides global settings for the game (e.g., resolution, controls).

---

### **3. Rendering Layer**

- **`ui.py`**:
    - Manages menus, gauges, and dialogue overlays.
- **`stage_manager.py`**:
    - Handles background, midground, and foreground layers for the stage.

---

### **4. Integration Layer**

- **`utils.py`**:
    - Provides utility functions for data loading and validation.
- **`logger.py`**:
    - Captures errors and debugging information.
- **`constants.py`**:
    - Stores globally used constants, ensuring consistency across modules.

---

## **Data Flow**

1. **Initialization**:
    - `main.py` loads configuration files from the `config/` folder and initializes game components.
2. **Gameplay**:
    - Player actions are processed by the Narrative Engine (`storyteller.py`), which influences game state.
    - Class-specific interactions (`classes.py`) modify gameplay outcomes, such as combat stats or story decisions.
3. **Rendering**:
    - `ui.py` and `stage_manager.py` dynamically update visuals based on the game state.
4. **Event Handling**:
    - `encounters.py` triggers events, which can lead to boss fights (`boss.py`) or narrative changes (`storyteller.py`).

## **Relational Mapping**

| **Component** | **Interacts With** | **Purpose** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `main.py` | All Modules | Orchestrates game loop and state updates. |
| `classes.py` | `storyteller.py`, `ui.py` | Influences narrative choices and stats. |
| `boss.py` | `stage_manager.py`, `ui.py` | Handles boss encounters and visual updates. |
| `storyteller.py` | `classes.py`, `ui.py` | Manages narrative progression and choices. |
| `ui.py` | `main.py`, `stage_manager.py` | Renders game state and player interactions. |
| `stage_manager.py` | `boss.py`, `ui.py` | Manages layered rendering of game elements. |

## **Future Considerations**

1. **Scalability**:
    - Modular design ensures easy addition of new classes, bosses, and narrative paths.
    - Explore procedural content generation for replayability.
2. **Performance Optimization**:
    - Optimize rendering pipelines for better frame rates on lower-end systems.
3. **Multiplayer Support**:
    - Consider designing APIs for future multiplayer capabilities.

---

## **Next Steps**

1. **Expand Documentation**:
    - Add detailed API references for core modules.
2. **Automate Testing**:
    - Integrate CI/CD pipelines for consistent validation of code changes.
3. **Enhance Modular Configurations**:
    - Introduce advanced JSON schemas for more flexible configurations.
